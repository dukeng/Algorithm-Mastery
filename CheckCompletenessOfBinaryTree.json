    "input" : "A binary tree",
    "output": "Return True if binary tree is complete. False otherwise",
    "solution": "Use a queue and a dictionary to bfs traverse tree (visit left then right) then keep track of the position that the next node has to be at: left child node = current_position * 2 - 1, right child node = current_position * 2. After that iterate through hashmap to check if it is complete. Check code on leetcode",
