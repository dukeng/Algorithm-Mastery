    "solution": "Sort it if it's not already sorted. The idea is similar to finding a pair with sum less than x but have another loop. For i in [0, len(arr) - 3], have l=i+1 and r=len(arr) -1 pointer. while l < r: if sum arr[l] + arr[r] + arr[i] < x it means that all pair from l, [l+1:r] are smaller than x. Then add to result (r-l) then increment l. Else (sum arr[l] + arr[r] + arr[i] > x) decrement r",
